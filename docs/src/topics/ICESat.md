# ICESat
The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (1) (ICESat) was the first earth-based LiDAR satellite[^schutz], launched in 2003, with the primary goal of ice sheet monitoring. It had an elevation accuracy of several cm[^schutz] and was operational for five years.

We currently support the GLAH06 (Land Ice) and GLA14 (Land Surface) data products (at version 34).
